val cup is not compostable in a home compost farm
Composting is a way to break down organic material into a long lasting fertilizer that helps improve the quality of the soil if your compost is stinky, then you need to add more brown materials (leaves, wood, newspaper) 
Leave out diseased or woody plant materials: Home compost are usually small and not high enough in temperature to kill pathogens in leaves/plants
Your compost garden is only ready when you cannot see your original material! No food or rotten smell! Relatively dark and moist! 
Garden needs four components: Brown Material (high in carbon), green material (high in nitrogen), water and air 
Green includes food scraps, grass clippings, manure, garden debris, and nonseedy weeds 
Brown includes leaves, straw, paper, sawdust, and woodchips
Water level should be close to a wrung out sponge (not too wet nor too dry) 
Rotate the pile frequently, which introduces air, and this will quicken your compost 
BE PATIENT: Typically takes 6-8 Months
AVOID ANIMAL OR DAIRY PRODUCTS
