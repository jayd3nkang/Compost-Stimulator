The main objective of our game is to teach people about common and confusing compostable household items/trash. 
They will be building a compost garden with these items. 
The better a player does at differentiating compostable and non-compostable items, the better their garden looks.
Our game has three windows: home, popup, and garden 
The home window cycles through day and night by changing the sun and moon position along with the sky (no user input is required at this stage)
Popup window pop ups after the end of the day and will have a list of items to either compost or categorize as other 
Player will interact with the game by clicking on “Compost” or “Other” button
After all items have been organized, they will be shown an “End of Day Summary” that indicates which items player got wrong that day and their total score 
Then they will be directed to the garden window that shows a certain stage of a flower (dead, sprout, flowering, and fully blossomed).
Then player can click “Next Day” button to repeat this cycle.
To run the code, input either “javac Main.java” or “java *.java” then “java Main” command lines
Have fun!
